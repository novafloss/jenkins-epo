=========================
 Writing ``jenkins.yml``
=========================

``jenkins.yml`` allow developers to define per project configuration of the CI
pipeline. The ``jenkins.yml`` file provide a mapping of all jobs to manage. The
special entry ``settings`` allow to overrides some defaults settings.


Defining a job
==============

The simplest job definition is a oneline YAML entry:

.. code-block:: yaml

   app-job: tox -r

Commands are wrapped in a ``bash`` script, executed with ``-eux`` shell options.
This mean that any failing command breaks the job, undefined variable are not
accepted and each executed command is echoed on stderr.

You can actually add a bunch of Jenkins job feature in YML:

.. code-block:: yaml

   app-job:
     # Target a specific node or node label
     node: slave0
     # Matrix. Only values in YML are triggered
     axis:
       TOXENV:
       - py34
       - py35
     # job parameterer, value is always read from YML
     parameters:
       TESTS: tests/
     # The script
     script: |
       tox -re $TOXENV -- $TESTS
     # clean up script, executed even on cancel/abort.
     after_script: |
       rm -rf coverage.xml


Tests report and coverage
=========================

``jenkins.yml`` generated Jenkins jobs are full featuredÂ !

- Archive all files in ``$CI_ARTEFACTS`` directory.
- Import all ``$CI_ARTEFACTS/xunit*.xml`` files to generate a test report.
- Feed `Cobertura
  <https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin>`_ plugin with
  ``$CI_ARTEFACTS/coverage.xml`` to generate a coverage report.

.. code-block:: yaml

   app-units: |
     pytest -vvvv --strict --showlocals \
         --junit-xml={env:CI_ARTEFACTS}/xunit.xml \
         --cov=app --cov-report=xml:{env:CI_ARTEFACTS}/coverage.xml


Defining a pipeline
===================

EPO provides a simple pipeline inspired by `GitLab CI
<https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/pipelines.html>`_. Jobs are groupped by stage.
Default defined stages are ``build``, ``test`` and ``deploy``. The default stage
of a job is ``test``. Here is a sample pipeline.

.. code-block:: yaml

   settings:
     stages: [build, test, deploy]

   app-build:
     # Attach job to one stage of the CI pipeline
     stage: build
     script: make

   app-test:
     stage: test
     script: make test

   app-deploy:
     stage: deploy
     # Limit job on specific branch
     branches: master
     script: fab prod update


No jobs are triggered if the previous stage has a missing or failed build.

There is nothing like manual build or environment. Also there is no UI yet other
than GitHub.


Create a periodic job
=====================

You can define periodic job from ``jenkins.yml``. Theses jobs are **never**
triggered on push. Jenkins EPO take care of maintaining the job in Jenkins
according to the latest ``jenkins.yml`` version.

.. code-block:: yaml

   app-task:
     # Run this job around 3:00AM
     periodic: H 3 * * *
     # Run only on master
     default_revision: refs/heads/master


Periodic jobs can be part of pipeline stage. The stage will be completed only
when the periodic job will succeed. However, periodic jobs are out of pipeline
by default.
